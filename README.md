## Summary
This repo contains my code for training an ML model using Google's TensorFlow library to recognize handwritten numbers. It has been trained and tested on the famous MNIST *(Modified National Institute Of Standards And Technology)* Dataset.

## Current Status
This project is complete. âœ…

To find the trainied model file, you will be able to find it in the [release section](https://github.com/silverlightning926/tensorflow-mnist/releases) of this repository or here [model.keras](./model.keras).

## Getting Started

To get started with this machine learning model for recognizing handwritten numbers, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tensorflow-mnist.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Load the dataset, build the model, and train the model by running this command
    ```bash
    python ./src/main.py
    ```

6. Congratulations! You have successfully set up and trained the machine learning model for recognizing handwritten numbers using TensorFlow.

Feel free to explore the code and make any modifications as needed.

## Dependencies
- Python3 - Developed on Python Version 3.12.3
- Keras - Developed Keras Version 3.3.3
These requirements can be found in and downloaded by using [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)

## Linting with Autopep8
To ensure consistent code formatting, you can use Autopep8, a Python library that automatically formats your code according to the PEP 8 style guide. To install Autopep8, run the following command:
```bash
pip install autopep8
```

Once installed, you can use Autopep8 to automatically format your code by running the following command:
```bash
autopep8 --in-place --recursive ./src
```

This will recursively format all Python files in the current directory and its subdirectories.

Remember to run Autopep8 regularly to maintain a clean and consistent codebase. This repo contains the Python Lint GitHub Workflow to ensure the repository stays linted.

If you are using VSCode, you can download and the [Autopep8 VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.autopep8) and add these lines to your `settings.json` to format with Autopep8 automatically as you type and when you save.
```json
"[python]": {
        "editor.formatOnType": true,
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "ms-python.autopep8"
    }
```

## Technologies
The technologies used in this project include but are not limited to:
- Python: The main programming language used for developing the machine learning model and associated scripts.
- TensorFlow: A popular open-source machine learning framework developed by Google, for nueral network and machine learning development.
- Keras: A high-level neural networks API written in Python, used as a user-friendly interface to TensorFlow for building and configuring the model architecture.
- Git: A distributed version control system used for tracking changes and collaborating on the codebase.
- GitHub Actions: A CI/CD platform provided by GitHub, used for automating the linting workflow and displaying the linting badge in the README.
- Autopep8: A Python library used for automatically formatting the code according to the PEP 8 style guide.

## Dataset
The machine learning model for recognizing handwritten numbers in this repository is trained and tested on the MNIST dataset. MNIST, short for *Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology*, is a widely used dataset in the machine learning community for handwritten digit classification tasks. It consists of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples, where each example is a 28x28 grayscale image of a handwritten digit (0 through 9). The dataset is preprocessed and formatted to facilitate training and evaluation of machine learning models.

You can download the MNIST dataset directly from the [MNIST website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) or, as this project did, through the version baked into TensorFlow.

## Model Architecture
The machine learning model for recognizing handwritten numbers in this repository is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The CNN consists of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

The input to the model is a 28x28 grayscale image of a handwritten digit. This is encoded in a [28, 28, 1] wector filled with lumnosity values from 0-1. The first layer of the CNN is a convolutional layer that applies a set of learnable filters to the input image, extracting features such as edges and textures. This is followed by a pooling layer that reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, helping to capture important information while reducing computational complexity.

The process of convolution and pooling is repeated multiple times, allowing the model to learn increasingly complex and abstract features from the input image. The final feature maps are then flattened and passed through one or more fully connected layers, which perform classification based on the learned features.

To improve the model's performance and prevent overfitting, various techniques such as dropout and batch normalization are applied. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of the input units to 0 during training, reducing the model's reliance on specific features and improving generalization. Batch normalization normalizes the activations of the previous layer, making the model more robust to changes in input distribution.

The output layer of the model consists of 10 units, corresponding to the 10 possible classes (digits 0-9). The model uses a softmax activation function to produce a probability distribution over the classes, indicating the model's confidence in its predictions.

Overall, the model architecture is designed to effectively learn and classify handwritten digits, achieving high accuracy on the MNIST dataset.

## Results
I was able to get the model to have an accuracy of 97.69% on the MNIST dataset's test data. This was after training the model on the training data for 100 epochs, with a batch size of 8. 

At this point, more training came with increasingly more diminishing returns, with accuracy increasing very slowly.
